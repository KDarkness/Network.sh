# Network.sh
The script works by first getting the current date and time. Then, it gets the IP address, DNS servers, and open ports. Next, it creates a file to store the network information and writes the network information to the file. Finally, it displays the network information to the console and exits the script.
I chose to add the following information to the script:
The DNS servers
The open ports
